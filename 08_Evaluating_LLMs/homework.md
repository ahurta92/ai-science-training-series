# Answer 

I think a particularly good use of LLMs for science is simply to generate text, code, and ideas.  I find that 
are good at helping me getting started on a project or a paper.
In some cases, I've used used chat-gpt to get started with some basic code or even to get started
with generating a project directory for an idea.  It has help me speed up my development by what feels like 
10 fold.  In this case, I would evaluate the llm by how well it improves my productivity.  I don't believe that
in this capacity llms need to be perfect because they are just a tool to help me get started.

In a similar way, I was very impressed to see work which used to generate new target molecules for drug discovery.
I think this case is effective because the candidate molecules ultimately need to be tested in the lab and
the results can be used to improve the model.
